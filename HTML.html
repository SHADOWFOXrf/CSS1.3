            The theory of the cosmos integrates various disciplines, 
            including astronomy, physics, philosophy, and metaphysics. 
            The following is an overview of different theories 
            related to the cosmos:

            <p id="BigBangUTitle">BIG BANG THEORY</p>

            <p id="BigBangInfo">
                This is the most recent theory explaining the origin and 
                evolution of the universe. The Big Bang theory suggests that 
                the history of the universe began with the Big Bang around 
                13.8 billion years ago. As a result of the Big Bang, time, 
                space, and all matter were created, leading to the expansion 
                of the cosmos.

            <p id="BlackHoleInfo">
                Black holes form from the collapse of very massive stars. 
                These are regions where gravity is so intense that nothing, 
                not even light, can escape. Black holes interact with nearby 
                matter and can emit radiation.

            <p id="StringUTitle">STRING THEORY</p>

            <p id="StringInfo">
                String theory is one approach that seeks a unified 
                description of the physical world. According to this 
                theory, we live in a three-dimensional space on Earth, 
                but the cosmos might contain additional microscopic, 
                non-material "strings" (vibrating filaments) that are part 
                of confined spaces with different sizes and characteristics.
            </p>

            <p id="StringPoints">Here are three key points about String Theory:</p>

            <ul id="StringsUl">
                <li>
                    Unified Description of the Universe: String theory seeks to 
                    provide a single framework that explains all fundamental 
                    forces and particles in the universe, including gravity, 
                    electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Extra Dimensions: While we experience a three-dimensional 
                    space, string theory proposes the existence of additional 
                    microscopic dimensions that are compactified, potentially 
                    influencing the laws of physics.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Vibrating Strings: According to string theory, the 
                    fundamental building blocks of matter are not point-like 
                    particles but rather one-dimensional "strings" that 
                    vibrate at different frequencies, with each vibration 
                    corresponding to a different particle type.
                </li>
            </ul>
